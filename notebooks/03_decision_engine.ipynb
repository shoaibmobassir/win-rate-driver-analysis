    "\n",
    "### Use Case 1: Pipeline Prioritization\n",
    "**Action**: Review open deals and prioritize those with positive drivers (e.g., certain lead sources, ACV ranges, industries)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \"Focus sales efforts on deals from Referral and Partner sources in Mid-Market ACV range\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case 2: Resource Allocation\n",
    "**Action**: Redirect sales and marketing resources away from segments with negative drivers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \"Reduce investment in Outbound leads for Enterprise deals, shift to Inbound and Referral\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case 3: Enablement & Coaching\n",
    "**Action**: Provide targeted training on deals with negative driver patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \"Train reps on Enterprise deal qualification - these deals are taking longer and closing less\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Use Case 4: Strategic Planning\n",
    "**Action**: Use changed drivers to understand market shifts and adjust strategy\n",
    "\n",
    "**Example**: \"Enterprise deals became negative drivers recently - investigate competitive pressure or pricing issues\"\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations & Next Steps\n",
    "- **Correlation ≠ Causation**: These are associations, not proven causes\n",
    "- **Need Qualitative Validation**: Discuss findings with sales leaders to understand context\n",
    "- **Monitor Over Time**: Re-run analysis monthly to track if interventions are working"
